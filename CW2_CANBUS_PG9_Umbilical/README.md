# Clockwork 2 CANBUS PG9 Umbilical
Designed for the Voron 2.4 around the Mellow Fly SB2040, however it should work for the Trident and similar CANBUS boards which utilizes the Hartk SB PCB mount.

This is an extension to my IMX258 Nozzle Camera mod just without the driver board mounting as I have been doing these 2 mods at the same time.
